# Multiverse-Reinforcement-Learning-MRL-
 MRL works by creating a virtual multiverse of possible universes, each with its own set of data. MRL then trains a reinforcement learning agent to explore this multiverse and learn to perform a given task in all of the universes. This process forces the agent to learn a generalizable model that can work in a variety of different environments.
