# Multiverse-Reinforcement-Learning-MRL-
 MRL works by creating a virtual multiverse of possible universes, each with its own set of data. MRL then trains a reinforcement learning agent to explore this multiverse and learn to perform a given task in all of the universes. This process forces the agent to learn a generalizable model that can work in a variety of different environments.

 SETUP&GUIDELINES
 
 To use MRL, you will need to:

Create a Universe class for each universe that you want to learn from. This class should implement a "step()" method that returns the reward and next state for a given state and action.
Create an MRLAgent class and initialize it with the number of universes that you want to learn from.
Train the MRL agent by calling the "act()", "step()", and "learn()" methods in a loop.
Once the agent is trained, you can evaluate it by calling the "evaluate()" method.
