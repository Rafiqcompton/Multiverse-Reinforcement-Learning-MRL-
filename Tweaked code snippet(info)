The tweaked MRL algorithm can now:

Learn more robust and generalizable models by exploring multiple universes simultaneously.
Avoid overfitting to a single universe by forgetting old universes and exploring new ones.
Learn more complex models that can generalize to a wider variety of environments by using a hierarchical approach.
