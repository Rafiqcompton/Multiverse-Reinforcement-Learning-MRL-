To use MRL, you will need to:

Create a Universe class for each universe that you want to learn from. This class should implement a "step()" method that returns the reward and next state for a given state and action.
Create an MRLAgent class and initialize it with the number of universes that you want to learn from.
Train the MRL agent by calling the "act()", "step()", and "learn()" methods in a loop.
Once the agent is trained, you can evaluate it by calling the "evaluate()" method.
